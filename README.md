# Heat-and-Water-Demand-Forecasting-Challenge


## Abstract
This project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to forecast heat and water demand in a District Metered Area (DMA) in northern Denmark. Accurate forecasting is critical for optimizing resource usage, enhancing energy efficiency, and reducing operational costs in industries like urban planning, agriculture, and energy management.

The LSTM model predicts demand 24 hours in advance using hourly heat, water consumption, and meteorological data. Model performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Results show that the LSTM network effectively captures temporal patterns, delivering accurate and reliable demand forecasts.

## Features
- **Deep Learning Approach**: LSTM network for time series forecasting
- **Prediction Horizon**: 24 hours in advance
- **Metrics**: MAE and MAPE for performance evaluation
- **Data Sources**: Hourly heat and water usage data, meteorological data
